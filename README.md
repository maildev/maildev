**MailDev** is a simple way to test your project's generated email during development, with an easy to use web interface that runs on your machine built on top of [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org).

## API

MailDev can be used in your Node.js application. For more info view the
[API docs](https://github.com/maildev/maildev/blob/master/docs/api.md).

```javascript
const MailDev = require("maildev");

const maildev = new MailDev();

maildev.listen();

maildev.on("new", function (email) {
  // We got a new email!
});
```

MailDev also has a **REST API**. For more info
[view the docs](https://github.com/maildev/maildev/blob/master/docs/rest.md).

## Outgoing email

Maildev optionally supports selectively relaying email to an outgoing SMTP server. If you configure outgoing
email with the --outgoing-* options you can click "Relay" on an individual email to relay through MailDev out
to a real SMTP service that will *actually\* send the email to the recipient.

Example:

    $ maildev --outgoing-host smtp.gmail.com \
              --outgoing-secure \
              --outgoing-user 'you@gmail.com' \
              --outgoing-pass '<pass>'

### Auto relay mode

Enabling the auto relay mode will automatically send each email to it's recipient
without the need to click the "Relay" button mentioned above.
The outgoing email options are required to enable this feature.

Optionally you may pass an single email address which Maildev will forward all
emails to instead of the original recipient. For example, using
`--auto-relay you@example.com` will forward all emails to that address
automatically.

Additionally, you can pass a valid json file with additional configuration for
what email addresses you would like to `allow` or `deny`. The last matching
rule in the array will be the rule MailDev will follow.

Example:

    $ maildev --outgoing-host smtp.gmail.com \
              --outgoing-secure \
              --outgoing-user 'you@gmail.com' \
              --outgoing-pass '<pass>' \
              --auto-relay \
              --auto-relay-rules file.json

Rules example file:

```javascript
[
  { allow: "*" },
  { deny: "*@test.com" },
  { allow: "ok@test.com" },
  { deny: "*@utah.com" },
  { allow: "johnny@utah.com" },
];
```

This would allow `angelo@fbi.gov`, `ok@test.com`, `johnny@utah.com`, but deny
`bodhi@test.com`.

## Configure your project

Configure your application to send emails via port `1025` and open `localhost:1080` in your browser.

**Nodemailer (v1.0+)**

```javascript
// We add this setting to tell nodemailer the host isn't secure during dev
process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0";

const transport = nodemailer.createTransport({
  port: 1025,
  // other settings...
});
```

**Django** -- Add `EMAIL_PORT = 1025` in your settings file [[source]](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-EMAIL_PORT)

**Rails** -- config settings:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
        address: "localhost",
        port: 1025,
        enable_starttls_auto: false
    }
```

**Drupal** -- Install and configure [SMTP](https://www.drupal.org/project/smtp) module or use a library like [SwiftMailer](http://swiftmailer.org/).

## Ideas

If you're using MailDev and you have a great idea, I'd love to hear it. If you're not using MailDev because it lacks a feature, I'd love to hear that too. Add an issue to the repo [here](https://github.com/maildev/maildev/issues/new).

## Contributing

Any help on MailDev would be awesome. There is plenty of room for improvement. Feel free to [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/maildev/maildev/issues/new) from small to big changes.

To run **MailDev** during development:

    npm install
    npm run dev

The "dev" task will run MailDev using nodemon and restart automatically when
changes are detected. On `*.scss` file save, the css will also be recompiled.
Using `test/send.js`, a few test emails will be sent every time the application
restarts.

The project uses the [JavaScript Standard coding style](https://standardjs.com).
To lint your code before submitting your PR, run `npm run lint`.

To run the test suite:

    $ npm test
