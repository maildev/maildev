# Docker

MailDev works quite conveniently with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for
your development setup. You can use the
[`maildev/maildev`](https://hub.docker.com/r/maildev/maildev)
image on Docker Hub or pull this repo down and build an image yourself using
the included Dockerfile. Here is a short guide on how to use MailDev with Docker.

## Simple usage

To get MailDev up and running quickly, run a new container using the image.
If you don't have the image on your machine, Docker will pull it. Let's name
it "maildev" and publish the interface on port `1080`:

```
$ docker run -p 1080:1080 --name maildev maildev/maildev
```

Now the MailDev UI will be running at port `1080` on your virtual machine
(or machine if you're running Linux). For example if your Docker host VM is
running at `192.168.99.100`, you can head over to `http://192.168.99.100:1080`
to visit the interface.

Let's say you're using [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer)
in your Node.js app running in another container. Let's link your app's
container with MailDev:

```
$ docker run -p 8080:80 --link maildev yourimage
```

From within your app's container, Docker will expose some helpful environment
variables. `MAILDEV_PORT_25_TCP_ADDR` and `MAILDEV_PORT_25_TCP_PORT` can be
used to send your emails. Sending them here will result in them being captured
by MailDev. Here's an example of using these with Nodemailer:

To pass parameters, because the Dockerfile uses CMD, you need to specify the executable again.
The Dockerfile specifically EXPOSES port 80 and 25, therefor you need to tell maildev to use them.
This example adds the base-pathname parameter.

```
$ docker run -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 maildev/maildev bin/maildev --base-pathname /maildev -w 1080 -s 1025
```


```js
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  // In Node, environment variables are available on process.env
  host: process.env.MAILDEV_PORT_25_TCP_ADDR, // ex. 172.17.0.10
  port: process.env.MAILDEV_PORT_25_TCP_PORT, // ex. 25
  // We add this setting to tell nodemailer the host isn't secure during dev:
  ignoreTLS: true
})

// Now when your send an email, it will show up in the MailDev interface
transporter.sendMail({ /* from, to, etc... */ }, (err, info) => { /* ... */ });
```

The above example could apply for any app in any language using the available
environment variables to configure how to send email.

## Advanced usage

*Needs documentation for how to use cli arguments*

## Docker Compose

To use MailDev with Docker Compose, add the following to your
`docker-compose.yml` file in the `services` section:

```yaml
  maildev:
    image: maildev/maildev
    ports:
      - "1080:80"
```

Here's an example using Nodemailer:

```js
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'maildev',
  port: 25,
  // We add this setting to tell nodemailer the host isn't secure during dev:
  ignoreTLS: true
});

// Now when your send an email, it will show up in the MailDev interface
transporter.sendMail({ /* from, to, etc... */ }, (err, info) => { /* ... */ });
```

Note that the host name, `maildev`, is the name of the service in your
`docker-compose.yml` file.
